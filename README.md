# Prework-reading

Quantity < Quality: It is better to do more work that is that is less precise than to try and take your time and acheive perfection. You will end up with higher quality work in the long run through repition.

Clean Code: Clean code might seem like it takes more time but it will save you time in the long run. Clean code is vital to the long term health of a project. Cleanliness is next to godlines. Your code should be elegant and concise. Avoid redundancy. 

Red Green: In the Red Phase write your tests and set expectations. In the green phase meet expectations and make tests pass. During refactor refine your code.

TDD: 
The  the three laws of the Nano-cycle:
"You must write a failing test before you write any production code.
You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass."
Minute by minute is the same as the Red Green. 
Decaminute is a broader more generic testing cycle.
Hour by hour is for overall functionality.
